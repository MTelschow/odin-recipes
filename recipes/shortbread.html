    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        This is a compilation of several Shortbread recipes I have from British cookbooks. I have been to England three times and REAL shortbread is a favorite. It should use real butter and not be TOO sweet. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white rice flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with greaseproof (parchment) paper. Sift the flour and rice flour into a medium mixing bowl. Add the sugar and mix.</li>
        <li>Cut butter into pieces and rub into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture begins to bind together. Knead into soft dough.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into an 8 inch round (or for exact round, mold it in an 8 inch cake pan). Place on baking sheet. Using a fork, prick top and make tine marks along edge. Using a table knife, score top with wedge marks. (This is where it will break when cooled)</li>
        <li>Bake 45 minutes or until pale golden in color. Sprinkle a little superfine sugar over top and cool on baking sheet. Cut into wedges. Keeps for weeks in airtight tin.</li>
    </ol>
